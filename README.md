# python-code-disasters

## What is it all about?
I am, due to my work, seeing a lot of code written by other developers. Sometimes this code is so bad, that it is worth showing to the outer world.

## [Privacy](#privacy)
Privacy is very important. There are two things basically: 

1. Refactor your code to remove anything, that might violate any security requirements, corporate rules or license agreements.
2. It is not a goal of this project to insult or offend anyone, so, please, remove any brand-names, user marks, `__author__` variables and so on.

## Save yourself!

Then use [`wemake-python-styleguide`](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide) which is the strictest `python` linter in existance.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute. Before contributing, please, double check the [Privacy](#privacy) section.
Refactor your code to remove as much as you can to leave just the most valuable parts. I think that submitting a broken code is not an issue for this project. Moreover, formatting the code is also not required. Sometimes it is even better to leave it's formation untouched.

It is generally a good practice to read through your old files and contribute your own code.

It is still not clear to me, how to structure this project.
